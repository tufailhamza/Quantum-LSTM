# Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM)

This project implements the Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) model, a quantum-inspired deep learning architecture designed to enhance the performance of classical LSTM models using quantum computing principles. The QLSTM is inspired by the classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks commonly used in tasks like natural language processing and speech recognition.

## **Project Overview**

Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the field of deep learning by offering faster and more efficient models. One promising application of quantum computing in machine learning is the development of **quantum neural networks**, which use quantum mechanics principles such as superposition and entanglement to process and learn from data. The **QLSTM** is one such quantum neural network designed to address the limitations of classical LSTMs and enable more efficient training and inference on quantum computing platforms.

The main objective of this project is to implement and evaluate the QLSTM model, as proposed in the paper *"Quantum Long Short-Term Memory"* by S. Chen, and explore its potential in deep learning tasks such as sequence classification and language modeling. The evaluation is conducted on well-known datasets like **IMDB Movie Review** (for sentiment analysis) and **WikiText** (for language modeling).
